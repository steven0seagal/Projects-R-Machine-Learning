# you won't be creating these simple variables though
# you will be creating different data types in R for machine learning. There are 4 types of atomic vector
# These data types are;
#Vectors
#Matrices
#Data Frames
#Lists
#Arrays
#Factors


# let's start with vector
# use C() function to create vectors
# C() stand for concatenate


# create vectors

#Merge the two lists.

# R Predefined Lists
# Lists for letters and month names are predefined:
# letters
#
# A matrix is a two-dimensional vector (fixed size, all cell types the same).
#
# array is a vector with one or more dimensions.
#An array with two dimensions is same as a matrix.
#An array with three or more dimensions is an n-dimensional array.
#
# A data frame is called a table in most languages. Each column holds the same type, and the columns can have header names.
#
# Arrays
# Create t wo vectors of different lengths.
